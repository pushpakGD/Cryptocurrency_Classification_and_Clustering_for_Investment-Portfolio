# Cryptocurrencies

## Background

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. In this project, we are going to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

Since the data is not ideal, it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Moreover, since there is no known output for what we are looking for, we have decided to use unsupervised learning and clustering algorithm. Finally, we will use data visualizations to share the findings.

## Aim
